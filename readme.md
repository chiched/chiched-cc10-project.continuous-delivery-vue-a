An App to Search 'KFlyer' Truck Stop Locations around America

Premises: 

*We have been hired by a truck stop company to create a single-page app so that travellers can search for truck stops based on a number of criteria.*

## User's manual

You can use our app on your desktop or mobile phone. Just go to our homepage and you will see a map of all available stores and truckstops in the U.S.

Click on the dropdown to select your state and then click on the 'Search' button.

You will be taken to the results page that will show you a listing of all available truck stores or travel shops in your state.

The information will include:

- address
- phone and fax number
- highway and exit number
- if it's a truck stop or travel shop
- number of parking spaces
- number of Def lanes



## Development

Follow this guide to set up your environment etc.

### Database

This project assumes a Postgres database, naturally, this is not included in the `package.json` file, so must be installed separately.

If you are on Windows using WSL, [this blogpost](https://medium.com/@harshityadav95/postgresql-in-windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl-6dc751ac1ff3) is very helpful.

Create a database called `truckstop`.

Create a `.config.js` file in the project root with this format:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  db: {
    client: "postgresql",
    connection: process.env.DB_URL || {
      host: process.env.DB_HOST || "127.0.0.1",
      port: process.env.DB_PORT || 5432,
      database: process.env.DB_NAME || "truckstop",
      user: "postgres", // <= Your command line username
      password: "postgres", // <= Your command line password
    },
  },
};
```

The migrations and seeds should automatically occur when the server is started using `yarn hack`.
However if you need to run them manually, please use `yarn migrate`, `yarn rollback`, and `yarn seed`.

### Future features

For now the app only filters on location, on the state to be precise. 

We will be adding more filters in the near future. Those will include more precise location filters, for example, city and highway. There will also be a possiblity to filter on amenities like ATM or Wifi.

For the trucker it will be possible to filter on the service provided. For example, on 'oil changes', 'light mechanical work', 'tirepass' or 'Truck tire care'. 

For the casual traveller we will add the possibility to filter the restaurants.

Those changes will be added gradually over the next weeks.



We will also add more info about the truck stores and travel shops.
